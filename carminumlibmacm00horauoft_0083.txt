numu] - Wickham has a good note, that ‘ the· poete, and
especially Horace, use the names of natione and tribes 110
adjectivee instead of the fuller derivative forms in —ius or -ieua'
cf. 2. 9. 1, Medum flumen. 3. 7. 3, Thyna merce. Virg. Aen.
6. 877, 'Romula ullus.

11. aegis, αἰγίς (from ἀΐσσω 10 fiash, or αῐξ a goat). For
a full description of it see n. 5. 735, &a See also met. Ant.
0. v. for representatione of Athena wearing it.

12. currus et rabiem] Notice the combination of the
abstraot and the concrete, ‘prepares her chariot and wrathss
Orelli remarks that this is a favourite usage with Tacitus z
ef. ΔΜ. 1. 68, vulqus trucidatum est dome ira et dies permansit.
For Horaee’s phrase cf. Hymns Ancient and Modern, 156:

‘His chariots of wrath the thunder-olouds form?

13. nequiquam] ‘Vainly confident in Venus’ guardian-
ship shalt thou oomb thy love-looks, and apportion on the
unwarlike lute the songs that ladies love?

Cf. Hom. Π. 3. 54 :

οὒκ ἄν τοι χραίσμῃ κίθαρις τά. τε δῶρ’ ’Δφροδίτης,
ἥ τε κόμη τό ,τε εἶδος, ὅτ’ ἐν κονίῃσι μιγείης.

Valeri! praesidio] Because he had awarded her the

{olden apple in the famous judgment of Paris. Cf. Tennyson’s
enone.

14. pectes mesas-lem...] Notiee the feminine softness and
beauty Horace has imparted to these two lines. In all great
poete the language used is, perhaps uneonseiously, modified
00 as almost in its sound 1ο correspond to the feelings or events
they describe: a comparison between Milton’s rugged power
in ἄθεοι-1111113 Satan and Heu, and his melodicus softness in
“ portraying Eve and Paradise, well illustrates this.

15. earmina divides] Orelli explains this, ‘ divide the song
1101110011 the voice and instrument) But when we think of
the Latin use of modi, numeri, and the English ‘measure.’
there would seem little doubt that the phrase means ‘to set
songs to a measure, or, to music! The rendering, ‘ will divide

songs to women,' i. e. sing one to one and another to another
lady, is simple but intolerable.

16. thalamo] Cf. 11. 3. 381, of Venus saving Paris from the
light, ἐκάλυψε δ’ ἄρ’ ἠέρι πολλῇ κὰδ δ’ etc' ἐν θαλάμῳ εὐώδεϊ
κηώεντι. Translate, ‘in your bri al chambet!
