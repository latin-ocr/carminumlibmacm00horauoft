For the pupils, the earliest geographioel lason-book put into their
handsshould be one that will take up their training at the point to
which the oral laesons and demonstration os the tmcher have brought
them. It should deal with their own country, mrrying out the same
kind of instruction to which they have already become aoeustomed.

the wudd as a whole and of its planetary relations, will be reach

Thmughout such a series of geogmphiml class-books the fundamental
iden should be to present the essential facts in such a way as will show

their relationship to meh other, and will convey to the mind of the
pupil a clear picture of the country or subject described. For instance,
the physieal features will be connected with the dimatology of a country,
and both will be shown to affect the distribution of life, while the bear-
ing of all thoee influenooe upon human history and commercia] progne-s
will be constantly kept in view. The boundarioe os pariebas and
countrioe, the positionis os towns and the diffusion os populafion, will
be linked with their geographioel explanation. A knowledge of the
topography of a country, and os the looel names by which it is exprmsed,
will be shown to be the necessary aecompanimem of an ad uate
knowledge of the history of the inhabitants. In short, it should a
constant aim to represent geography not as a series of numerioel tabloe
ora string of disoonnected facts, but as a luminous description of the

earth and its inhabitants, and of the oeusoe that regulate the contrasts of
' the somery, climate, and life.
