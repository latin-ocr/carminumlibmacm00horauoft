ODE VII.

‘Many fair and favourite places are there on earth, none
that 1 Iove so fondly as Tibur. Do you Plancus, whether as now
iu camp or, ae you will be soon, we trust, at Tibur, remember
that it is occasionally true philosophy to forget care in wine?
'l'hink of the example of Teucer in 1113 troubles:

.11. Munatius Plancus (i-e. splay-footed), consul ac. 42 and
founder of Lugdunum (Lyons), an accomplished trimmer
during the civil ware, who however seems to have enjoyed con-
siderable favour or influence with Octavian, who received the
title of Augustus on his proposal B. c. 27. ,

At this time he seems to have been suffering from melan-
choly and a desire to quit Italy. By hia use of tenebit, in con·
trast to tenent in line 20, Horace really addressae an invitation
to Plancus to come to Tibur, of which he has already sung the
praisea. 'l'his mayseem to lay too much stresson tenent ex-
cept to those who recollect that Horace isvery fond of this uae
of the future, that he would certainly not use tenebit after
tenent without a definite obiect, and that he wishes to suggest
such a residence rather than openly propose it. Moreover this

scietrlus ude only way of connecting the earlier and later portione

1. laudabunt] Cf. Od. 6. 1,=‘othera shall praise' (for all
1 care), i. e. let others praise.

2. bimaris] The two harbours of Corinth, Lechaeum on
&offomc Gulf, Cenchreae on the Crissaean Gulf, are well

4. Tempe] Notice Tempe, neuter pluras, like τείχη.
