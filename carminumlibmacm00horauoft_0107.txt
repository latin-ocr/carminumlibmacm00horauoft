NOTES. 95

2. aremus] Δ distinguished mathematician (mensorem
maris...) of Tarentum: lived about ac. 400. He was of the
Pythagorean school of philosophy, cf. lines 10—12. Some
infer from this Ode that he was drowned and unburied, others
that his tomb was a noted spot on the Matine coast, see note
on munera.

3. pulveris...] There is an obvious contrast between his

boundless genius and narrow tomb. cf. Shakespeare, Hem-y
1v. Part 1, Act 5, Se. 4,

‘When that this body did contain a spirit,
A kingdom for it was too small a bound5
But now two paces of the vilest earth

Is room enough)

Matinum] Probably the shore at the foot of Mt Garganus

4. munera] is technically used of the due and dutiful
bestowal of burial upon a empse, and seems to make the fact
that Archytas is spoken of as buried certain. These who
make Archytas the speaker in line 36, where he asks for
burial, are compelled to translate here ‘the gift of a little
dust,’ as though it meant ‘the want of the gift of . . . ,’ and
cohibent as=keep you here on the coast, it being impossible
for youhto enter Elysium until you receive the ‘three handfuls '
of eart .

5. aerias...] For this description of Arehytas' soaring
genius cf. the brilliant panegyrio on Epicurus in Luer. 1. 72,

erqo vivida vis animi pervicit, et extra
processit lonye flammantia moenia mundi
atque omne immensum peramavit mente animoque . . .

Gn mentum] Notioe the force this derives from its
posi on.

7—9. Pelopis genitor, Tithonus, Minos] See class. Diet.
and for Tithonus Tennyson’s poem of that name.

10. Panthoiden] See class. Dict. under ‘Pythagoras’ Even
he, notwithstanding his theory of μετεμψύχωσις or the trans-
migration of souls, and the fact that he had enjoyed several
lives, first as a peacock, then as Euphorbus (=Panthoides)
at Troy, then as Homer, then as Pythagoras, and finally
as Q. Ennius (ot. Persius, Sat. 6. 10. 11), has finally been
compelled to succumb to the great law of mortality. There
