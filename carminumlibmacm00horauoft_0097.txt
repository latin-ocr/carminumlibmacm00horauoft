5. syrtes aestuosas] Orelli prefers the rendering ‘the

tuat unda.

casus ἀπάνθρωπος πάγος.

plored East about which numberless stories would be current
at Rome.

utter carelessness, a wolf fied from me though unarmed, a
monster such as neither...'

11. curis expeditis] Cares harass and hamper us (impe-
diunt), hence, curis expeditis, when the bonds of care are un-
loosened, 'a man is at ease, careless: it was in such a moment of

meet freedom and poetic abstraction that Horace ran into
ger.
