ΒΥ GEORGE SAINTSBURY. J„ a„ prm.

This is the sust instalment of a History of English Literature divided
into four main periods, each of which is entrusted to a writer who has
made that period his special study. The idea of the work was due in
the first instance to the late Mr. J. R. Green, whose view was that the
field of English literature was too vast to be adequately covered by any
single writer. Each writer will work independently, but the plan will,

period will be illustrated by ample specimens. 'l'he third and fourth
volumes, which have been undertaken respectively by Mr. Edmund
Gosse and Prof. Dowden, will appear, it is hoped, at no long interval
nster the present volume. The first volume, on the Early Literatnre,
hadbeen undertaken by Mr. Stopford Brooke; but, it being doubtful
whether his other engagements will admit of his fulfilling his intention,

&gemens are in progress for placing the work in other competent
