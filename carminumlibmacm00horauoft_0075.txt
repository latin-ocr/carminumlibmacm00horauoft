NOTES. 63

- ⁸ Whom doe's the Musa choose to sing of iu strains that may
re-eeho, like those of Orpheus, through the realms of poetry?
what god, demi-god, or godlike man? whatever the commence-
ment, the end must tell of the Julian house, of Augustus, and
its last-adopted scion, Marcellus)

1. quem virm...] Imitated from Pindar, 01. 2. 1,

ἀναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι
τίνα θεὸν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομενς ,
2. sumis celebrare] Verbs of wishing or resolving- natu-
rally take an infinitivo. A slight and poetic extension of this
liberty allows sumere (in the sense of ‘to ehoose ⁷) to do the same.

3, 4. ioeosa mago] ‘laughter-loving,’ or ‘sportive echo!
Cf. Vaticani numtis ima90‚ Od. 1. 20. 7. Eeho is a phantom
voice (imaqo vocis).

7. unde voealem...] ‘ whence the woods in random haste

followed the music of Orpheus.' The final syllable of temere is
always elided.

9. materna] i.e. of Calliope.

11. blandum et...] ‘Persuasive too to draw after him
with his tuneful stn'ngs the listening oaks.' blandum ducere,
so v· 25, nobilem superare. V. note on 3. 25.

aurita-s] Lit. long-eared. Here, I think, in the sense
⁰f ‘fflsszssffizsssffiksd ιῖΡᾱᾎωῖἶίοῗξίἒθ Ξῖξέῗῗὲηξᾝῖωἱῖξξ
ffi the vem-d unwgrthy of comment: it seems to me diffieult.

13. sontis] Two instances will suffice. Virg. Ecl. 111. 60,
A Jove principium, and Aratus, ἐκ Διὸς ἀρχώμεσθα ...............

...... τοῦ ’γὰρ καὶ ’γένος ἐσμέν (quoted by St Paul, Acts xvii. 28).
14. hommum ae deorum] Cf. Virg. Aen. 1. 230, Ο qui
res hominumque deumque Ι aeternis reyis imperiis.
It is to be noticed that Jupiter is rarely spoken of as ou a
level with the other gods: here the differenee is so great as to

be almost oue of kind, not merely of degree. In line 50 even
Jupiter is made in turn partly subordinate to the Fates.

15. vanisque...] ⁴ And regulates the universe with chang-
ing seasons.' mundum is used purposely: without Jove‘s

regulation the world would not be mundus, κόσμος, an ordered
universe, but anarchy and chaos. horae = ὧραι.
