ODE XXI.

An-Odainhonourof Apollo and Diana to be sung by a
ohorus of youths and maidens. Orelli is probably right in
maideringtheodetooslighttohavoboenwitoen for my
great publio occasion: the other commentators amuse them-
selves by guessing what the occasion may have been, the best
eonjeeture being that of Franke who suggests the year 28 n-c.
when the temple of Apollo on the Palatine was dedicated (see
Ode 31) and quinquennia] games instituted in memory of the
battle of Aetium in honour of Apollo and Diana. For the
whole ode cf. the cannen saeculare. Apollo and Diana always
go together under numerous names, e.g. Phoebus and Phoebe,
ἔειπε (Dianas), Diana, Sol and Luna, Apollo and Artemis:
they nte the male md female representatives of the eume
power.

2. intonsum] In Homer ἀκερσεκόμηςε he is repmsented as
eternally youthful. His statues are numerous: note especially
tho Apollo Bolvedere.

orntum] Cynthus is a mountain in Delos.

3. utem] or Leto was the mother of both Apollo md
Artemis in the island of Delos, Zeus being thei: satha.
